### Ex 4.48

*For a simple random sample of* $n$ *subjects, explain why it is about 95% likely that the sample proportion has error no more than* $1/\sqrt{n}$ *in estimating the population proportion. (Hint: To show this "*$1/\sqrt{n}$ *rule", find two standard errors when* $\pi = 0.50$*, and explain how this compares to two standard errors at other values of* $\pi$*.) Using this result, show that* $n = 1/M^2$ *is a safe sample size for estimating a proportion to within* $M$ *with 95% confidence.*

**Solution**

The sample proportion can be seen as the sample mean of a Bernoulli random sample with parameter $\pi$. Therefore, for the Central Limit Theorem, it is approximately normally distributed with mean $\pi$ and standard deviation:
$$
\sqrt{(1-\pi)\pi} \over \sqrt{n}
$$
This is also the standard error of the sample proportion because the standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution (or an estimate of that standard deviation).

For a normal distribution, about 95% of values fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This means that, in estimating the population proportion, it is about 95% likely that the sample proportion has error no more than:
$$
2 {\sqrt{(1-\pi)\pi} \over \sqrt{n}}
$$

However, note that $(1-\pi)\pi$ is maximized by $\pi = 0.5$. So, actually, the error is no more than:
$$
2 {\sqrt{(1-0.5)0.5} \over \sqrt{n}} = {1 \over \sqrt{n}}
$$
Using this result, we can find a safe sample size $n$ for estimating a proportion within $M$ with 95% confidence:
$$
M = {1 \over \sqrt{n}} \implies n = {1 \over M^2}
$$
