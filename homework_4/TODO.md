    * [x] Typos in the text: *3.5x3* -> $3.5x^3$ ecc.
    * [x] Missing higher order polynomial GLM in both tasks
    * [x] Errors in last lines: "is the 2nd" -> "is the 3rd"; "suggests the second" -> "suggests the third" (but might change when the missing higher order GLM is added)
  * [x] FSDS 7.28
    * a.
      * [x] Don't fit with all 17 variables (only 14): remove `subject` (no sense), `affil` and `life` (neither binary nor quantitative: see meanings in ex 1.2 FSDS)
    * b.
      * [x] Best lambda (`cv$lambda.min`) is 0.07134596 but model below is fitted with lambda 0.0783021
      * [x] Model fitted with lambda 0.09431516 is not used and so it's confusing
