### Ex 7.44

*For a sequence of independent binary trials, Exercise 2.69 showed the probability distribution of* $Y=$ *the number of successes before the* $k$*th failure. Show that this distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution (7.7), for* $\pi = \mu/(\mu + k)$*. (The geometric distribution is the special case* $k=1$*.)*

**Solution**

The probability mass function of $Y$ is:
$$
f(y;k,\pi) = {y+k-1 \choose y} \pi^y (1-\pi)^k, \quad y=0,1,2,...
$$
$\quad$ with the binomial coefficient defined as ${n \choose y} = {n! \over (n-y)!y!}$.\
\
The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is:
$$
p(y;\mu,k) = {\Gamma(y+k) \over \Gamma(k)\Gamma(y+1)}
             \left(\mu \over \mu+k\right)^y
             \left(k \over \mu+k\right)^k, \quad y=0,1,2,...
$$
$\quad$ with the gamma function defined as $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$.\
\
Let $\pi = {\mu \over \mu + k} = 1-{k \over \mu+k}$:
$$
p(y;\mu,k) = {(y+k-1)! \over (k-1)!y!} \pi^y (1-\pi)^k = f(y;k,\pi), \quad y=0,1,2,...
$$
So the distribution of $Y$ is a special case of the negative binomial distribution.

### Ex 8.4

*Refer to Exercise 8.1. Construct a classification tree, and prune strongly until the tree uses a single explanatory variable. Which crabs were predicted to have satellites? How does the proportion of correct predictions compare with the more complex tree in Figure 8.2?*
