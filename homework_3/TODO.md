    * (a)
      * [ ] say what $\pi$, $n$ and $y$ are (who reads the solution shouldn't go in search of ex 4.6 to understand what they are)
      * [ ] typo: pi -> $\pi$
      * [ ] "mean of this(??) posterior distribution"
      * [ ] typos: follow -> follows
      * [ ] typo: binomial distribution $(n,\pi)$ -> binomial distribution $B(n,\pi)$
      * [ ] "posterior distribution follow a Beta distribution": can a distribution follow a distribution?
      * [ ] typo: increase -> increases
      * [ ] typos?: $\alpha*$ -> $\alpha^\*$; $\beta*$ -> $\beta^*$
      * [ ] "Explain how the choice of prior distribution affects the posterior mean estimate": IMO it asks in general, so more informative prior distr implies estimate closer to prior mean
